-- 0119 — the payroll seam stops being nineteen fields short of the contract.
--
-- ── C20, and why a partial seam is worse than an absent one ───────────────
--
-- `ops_hr.payroll_figures` carried 27 fields; `PayrollLine` in
-- `src/services/hr/contracts.ts` asks for 43. The eight payroll screens are
-- kept dark by `isRouteLive()` because of it — `/hrd/payroll`, its run and
-- payslip pages, and the weekly view — and the live `hr` client simply has no
-- payroll functions, so in live mode they refuse with their own name rather
-- than quietly serving fixtures (ADR-009, and the trap `src/demo/api/index.ts`
-- documents at length).
--
-- Eighteen fields were genuinely missing and two were only spelled
-- differently, which is its own small lesson: `worked_days`/`days_worked` and
-- `open_days`/`days_open` are the same number wearing two names across one
-- seam, and a reader counting *missing* fields gets 20 where the work is 18.
-- Both spellings are kept — the old ones because `payroll_totals`, the views
-- and every existing caller use them, the new ones because that is what the
-- contract says and a client should not have to know about the rename.
--
-- ── added, not rebuilt ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `alter type … add attribute` rather than `drop type … cascade`: nothing
-- constructs a `payroll_figures` positionally (checked, not assumed —
-- `payroll_line_for` assigns field by field, and no `::ops_hr.payroll_figures`
-- cast exists anywhere in the ladder), so widening it leaves every caller
-- standing. A cascade would have dropped `payroll_line`, `period_lines`,
-- `run_lines`, `v_payroll_line` and `preview_pay_rules` and asked me to
-- remember to put them all back.
--
-- **Nothing here is computed twice.** Every added figure is either already in
-- a local variable by the time the loop ends (`pending_ot`, `n_withheld`,
-- `rate.company`, `rate.statutory`, `rate.annual`) or is a read the function
-- already makes and threw away (`overtime_parts`, `payroll_adjustments`). The
-- one genuinely new read is the contributions, and it is the one figure on a
-- payslip that comes from a different month's rate table (`0051`).
--
-- ── the day list ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `days` is the per-day breakdown a payslip prints, and it is built inside the
-- loop that was already walking those days. A slip that shows one total is a
-- slip somebody argues with at the counter and nobody can answer (D144), and
-- an **open** day — hours on the machine, nobody has read it, worth nothing
-- yet — is printed rather than hidden, because that is precisely the day an
-- employee is right to ask about (D156).
