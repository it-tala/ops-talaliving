-- 0202 — the pay week Jumat–Kamis, approved on Thursday with Thursday assumed
-- full, and Thursday's overtime paid the week after (D357).
--
-- Owner: *karyawan daily dibayar di hari Jumat. Pekerjaan di Jumat akan
-- dibayar di minggu depan, jadi payroll rilis di hari Kamis untuk di-approve.
-- Awal minggu ganti ke Jumat. Hari Kamis berikan HRD draft payroll dengan
-- asumsi absensi Kamis sudah lengkap termasuk clock out — untuk approval
-- pimpinan. Tapi di hari Jumat bisa berubah jika ada lembur di hari Kamis.*
-- Asked how Thursday's surprises should land, the owner chose: **only
-- Thursday's overtime moves to the next week**; a Thursday absence or early
-- leave is corrected by HRD by hand in the next week.
--
-- So, behind one rule-book key, `pay_week_assume_last_day` (opt-in; nothing
-- changes until a version says true):
--
--   * a period that is exactly one pay week — seven days starting on
--     `pay_week_starts_isodow` (default 5, Jumat; the client's
--     `PAY_WEEK_STARTS_DEFAULT`) — is *projected* for everybody not on a
--     monthly salary;
--   * its last day (Kamis), unless HRD marked it, counts as the full day the
--     schedule says: day value 1 at the weekday's multiplier, the scheduled
--     hours, no lateness, no overtime, never *open*. The approval is not held
--     by a Thursday that has not finished. The slip line says *asumsi*;
--   * the overtime the line pays is the week moved back one day — last
--     Thursday to this Wednesday — so every Thursday's approved overtime is
--     paid exactly once, the Friday after next.
--
-- A Thursday that turns out shorter than assumed is not corrected here: HRD
-- adds the adjustment to the next run, with its reason (D155), as the owner
-- chose. The warning on the line says so.
